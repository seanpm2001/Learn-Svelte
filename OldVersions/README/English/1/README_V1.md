### Learning Svelte (programming language)

I know very little about the Svelte programming language. This document will go over all of my knowledge of the Svelte programming language.

#### Hello World in Svelte

This is how you make a normal Hello World program in Svelte:

```svelte
<script>
    let hw = "Hello World"
</script>
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_

#### Comments in Svelte

Comments in Svelte are the same as in languages like HTML.

##### Single line comments

Single line comments in Svelte are written like so:

```svelte
<!-- This is a single line comment in Svelte !-->
```

##### Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments are the same, just more spread out. It can be written like so:

```svelte
<!-- This is
a multi-line
comment in
svelte !-->
```

#### Break keyword in Svelte

Svelte does not support the `break` keyword.

<!--
To this day, I am still not entirely sure what the `break` keyword does, but most languages support it.

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_
!-->

#### Executing a script in Svelte

This is how you return scripts in Svelte.

```svelte
<script>
    let script1 = "Test successful"
</script>
<p> {script1}!</p>
```

_/!\ This example has not been tested yet, and may not work_
